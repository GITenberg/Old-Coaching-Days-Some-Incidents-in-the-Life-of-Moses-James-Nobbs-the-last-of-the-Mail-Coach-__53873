<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the operation of the new Order
in Council regulating Civil Service superannuations, under which
officers who have attained the age of sixty-five
have&mdash;<i>nolens volens</i>&mdash;to take their pensions,
there will be, at the end of this year 1891, quite an exodus of
many who through the survival of the strongest and fittest are
still serving Her Majesty, although they have reached the
Psalmist&rsquo;s allotted span of three score years and ten.</p>
<p>The loss of our veterans in this manner will be accompanied by
many a pang of regret, but in the case of Mr. Moses James <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Nobbs, the last
of the Mail Coach Guards, who is now about to be pensioned, the
regret is softened by the circumstance that he recognises his
inability to work any longer, and finds the quiet and comfort of
country life at Uxbridge, to which place he is retiring, more
suitable than Post Office occupation at a busy London Railway
Station.</p>
<p>Mr. Nobbs has been in the service of the Post Office
fifty-five years.&nbsp; He commenced life as a Mail Guard, and
for years worked on Mail coaches.&nbsp; When the old coach system
was superseded by railway service Mr. Nobbs did postal duty for
some years as Mail Guard on the London and Exeter Railway, and
was afterwards appointed to superintend the receipt and despatch
of Mail bags at Paddington Station.&nbsp; Thus he was better
known to travellers of all degrees <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>on the Great Western line of Railway
than to his fellow-servants, with whom he was not brought much
into contact, owing to the fact that his duties confined him to
the Paddington Terminus.&nbsp; In order, therefore, that this
Post Office <i>rara avis</i> might be brought into
prominence&mdash;as his early retirement was then
foreseen&mdash;I wrote of him as follows in a published report on
the Post Office work in the Christmas Season of 1889:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Christmas postal traffic on the Great
Western Railway necessitated the running of the Night Mail train
in two portions between London and Penzance, the first part
taking the passengers, and the second being reserved exclusively
for the Mails.&nbsp; Strangely enough, the despatch of the Mails
from Paddington Station was superintended by the only <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Mail Coach
Guard now in the service, Mr. James Nobbs, who for over fifty
years has most faithfully looked after Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Mails.&nbsp; He well recollects that on Christmas Eve, 1839, just
prior to the introduction of the Penny Post, he was the Guard to
the Mail Coach running between Cheltenham and Aberystwith.&nbsp;
What a contrast!&nbsp; His Christmas night&rsquo;s load of Mails
in 1839 did not exceed a hundredweight.&nbsp; In 1889 he saw off
from Paddington twenty tons of Mail matter in the day, in the
most prosaic manner, with no blowing of musical horn, and no
carrying of deadly blunderbuss, as of yore.&nbsp; The still hale
and hearty old gentleman, in the picturesque costume of the Mail
Guard of the past, is a prominent figure at Paddington Station,
and long may he so remain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Mr. F. E.
Baines, C.B., Inspector-General of Mails, in his well-known
humorous style, gave in &ldquo;<i>Blackfriars</i>&rdquo; the
following account of a coach trip taken to Brighton by the chiefs
of the Post Office Department, to inaugurate a Parcel Post
Service by road with &ldquo;London-super-Mare&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Moses James Nobbs, the last (I think)
surviving Mail Guard, began work June 27th, 1836, and still does
duty as Mail Officer at Paddington.&nbsp; He could remember a
good deal in his fifty-three years of service.&nbsp; Old memories
must have revived as he went down from London to Brighton, two or
three years ago, as Guard in charge of the special trip of the
new Brighton Parcel Coach.&nbsp; He was fully equipped, as of
yore, for that perilous journey, a timepiece from Jamaica serving
to complete the outfit.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>We maintained (within an hour or two)
a moderate punctuality, but the tropic sun, or a luncheon at Red
Hill, I know not which&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;disturbed the due
action of the watch.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thrice armed the Guard who hath
his timepiece just.&rsquo;&nbsp; All the same, a blunderbuss from
Exeter was handed in at the last moment to make our armament
fourfold; and, I grieve to state, had, amidst the delighted and
(I fear) ironical cheers of a crowded courtyard, to be tied on to
the hind seat with official string.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Baines considerately omitted to say that Mr. Nobbs&rsquo;
attempts to blow the horn were somewhat of a failure.&nbsp; When,
for the sake of Auld Lang Syne, he was asked to act as guard to
the coach, he represented that he could not blow a horn owing to
having lost several teeth.&nbsp; He was, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>however,
persuaded to attempt it, and to practise beforehand.&nbsp;
Unfortunately his efforts in going down that busy London
artery&mdash;Cheapside&mdash;were futile, and the feeble sounds
he managed to extract from the horn excited the derision of all
the street urchins <i>en route</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Nobbs took his
discomfiture in perfect good humour, and I feel sure will not be
offended at this public allusion to the amusing incident.</p>
<p>Another <i>contretemps</i> on the same journey was the
stoppage of the coach at the bottom of Cheapside by the police on
account of the coachman&mdash;that well known jehu, Mr. John
Manley Birch&mdash;trying to take the coach on the wrong side of
a particular post.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Blackwood tried his
persuasive powers, Mr. Algernon Turnor threatened pains and
penalties for the <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>interference with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Royal Mail, but
the policemen were inexorable.&nbsp; The position was getting
rather ludicrous, and the immense traffic was being considerably
impeded, when, in a twinkling, our resolute coachman saw his
opportunity, and having for leaders two horses accustomed to run
in a fire-engine and quick to get a start, drove past the
astonished policemen&mdash;who were not prepared for such a
dash&mdash;and away we sped amid the plaudits of the assembled
crowd.</p>
<p>At the Conversazione at the South Kensington Museum in 1890,
in celebration of the Jubilee of Penny Postage, Mr. Nobbs, as one
of the oldest officers in the Postal Service, had the honour of
presenting to Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Edinburgh a
letter signed by old officers of the Post Office, who entered the
service <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>more than fifty years previously.&nbsp; Again, at a
meeting which was held at the General Post Office to inaugurate
the City Telegraph Messengers&rsquo; Institute, Mr. Nobbs in his
brilliant scarlet coat put Postmen and Telegraph Messengers quite
into the shade.&nbsp; He said at this meeting what a boon it
would have been to him if Institutes, with night classes, had
been formed in the days when he first donned Her Majesty&rsquo;s
uniform.&nbsp; If he could then have obtained the educational
advantages now enjoyed by every Telegraph Boy employed in the
City, he would not, after a period of fifty-five years of most
faithful and zealous service have occupied at the last the
comparatively subordinate position of a Mail Guard.</p>
<p>In order that this good old man may not depart without some
testimony that his sterling qualities have been recognised <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and
respected, it has occurred to me that the publication of some
incidents of his life, told by himself, may be of interest, as
the words of a man who has seen the old order of things entirely
displaced by the new, and who, by his integrity and unflagging
zeal in a long life of faithful devotion to duty, has well
exhibited&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The constant service of the antique
world,<br />
When service sweat for duty, not for meed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In introducing his interesting narrative, I would remark that
the self-sacrificing spirit which Mr. Nobbs displayed on the
trying occasions recalled in these reminiscences has
characterised the whole of his official career.&nbsp; He would
have deserved well of his country if he had done nothing more
than show by his example, as he <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>certainly has done, that he acted up
to the <i>bon mot</i>, given in his narrative, that he would
never &ldquo;damage his own health by drinking other
people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly no one should know so well
as an old Mail Guard how many people put an enemy in their mouths
to steal away their brains; and no doubt Mr. Nobbs has carried
many a Squeers who found it necessary to alight at every stage
&ldquo;to stretch his legs,&rdquo; but whose breath on getting up
again was redolent of gin.&nbsp; Mr. Nobbs has, however, done
more than present an example of self-control and
temperance.&nbsp; To use his own unaffected words, it has always
been his &ldquo;greatest ambition&rdquo; to do his duty
faithfully, and thus earn the confidence of his superior
officers.&nbsp; To this ambition he has been consistent
throughout.&nbsp; He has succeeded in winning the confidence and
esteem <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of
his official superiors, and he retires from the Service with
their heartiest good wishes.</p>

<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>SOME
INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF MOSES JAMES NOBBS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> retiring from the Service of the
Post Office after fifty-five years spent in harness, it has been
suggested to me that some account of my experience of Post Office
work in the days before the railways were established might be of
interest to many who have no knowledge of &ldquo;the good old
coaching days,&rdquo; except what they have acquired by hearsay
or from books.&nbsp; I will, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>therefore, set down a few of the
incidents that stand out most clearly in my memory.&nbsp; They
will show, at any rate, that life on a Mail Coach fifty years ago
was not all &ldquo;beer and skittles,&rdquo; though enjoyable
enough at times.</p>
<p>I was born in Angel Street, Norwich, on the 12th May,
1817.&nbsp; My father was a coach-builder, and had at that time a
contract for the construction and repair of the Mail and other
coaches running in and out of Norwich.&nbsp; I was brought up to
the same business until I was about nineteen, when my entry into
the Mail Service was brought about in this way.&nbsp; My father
was a staunch Whig, and about the year 1835 there happened to be
a General Election.&nbsp; In those times the polling at an
election lasted for fourteen days, and I can remember that I took
a very keen interest in the proceedings.&nbsp; My father had
seven tenants, and these were kept in reserve until the final day
of the polling, when they were the last men to vote.&nbsp; Their
votes carried the election.&nbsp; Some little time afterwards, <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the member
who was elected showed his gratitude to my father by getting me
an appointment in the Post Office Service.&nbsp; When I was
leaving home to take up my new duties, my father&mdash;who, no
doubt, knew the temptations of the life I was about to enter
upon&mdash;gave me an excellent piece of advice, which I never
forgot, and which was of great benefit to me in after
years.&nbsp; He told me &ldquo;Never to injure my own health by
drinking other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About Midsummer in 1836, then, I was sent down to act as guard
to the Mail from London to Stroud, and shortly afterwards was
transferred to the Mail running from Peterborough to Hull.&nbsp;
It was not very long before I had another change, and this time I
was appointed to the Portsmouth and Bristol Mail as a regular
duty.&nbsp; This was a night journey, and occupied about 12
hours&mdash;from 7.0 p.m. to 7.0 a.m.&nbsp; My duty as Mail Guard
was to take charge of the Mail bags and protect them.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>This
winter of 1836 was the first I passed on the road, and a severe
one it was too.&nbsp; There were terrible snow-storms towards
Christmas time, and many parts of the country were completely
blocked.&nbsp; I had one very rough experience of what my new
duties were to be like.&nbsp; After leaving Bristol one night at
7.0 p.m. all went well until we were nearing Salisbury, that is
to say, about midnight.&nbsp; Snow had been falling gently for
some time before, but after leaving Salisbury it came down so
thick and lay so deep that we were brought to a standstill, and
found it impossible to proceed any further.&nbsp; Consequently we
had to leave the coach and go on horseback to the next changing
place, where I took a fresh horse and started for
Southampton.&nbsp; There I procured a chaise and pair and
continued my journey to Portsmouth, arriving there about 6.0 p.m.
the next day.&nbsp; I was then ordered to go back to
Bristol.&nbsp; On reaching Southampton on my return journey I
found the snow <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>had got much deeper, and at Salisbury I found that the
London Mails had arrived, but could not proceed any further, the
snow being so very deep.&nbsp; Not to be done, I took a horse out
of the stable, slung the Mail bags over his back, and pushed on
for Bristol, where I arrived next day, after much wandering
through fields, up and down lanes, and across country&mdash;all
one dreary expanse of snow.&nbsp; By this time I was about ready
for a rest, but there was no rest for me in Bristol, for I was
ordered by the Mail Inspector to take the Mails on to Birmingham,
as there was no other Mail Guard available.&nbsp; At last I
arrived at Birmingham, having been on duty for two nights and
days continuously without taking my clothes off.&nbsp; I may add
that for my exertions and perseverance in getting the Mails
through I received a letter of thanks from the
Postmaster-General.</p>
<p>I remained on the Bristol and Portsmouth Mail for ten months,
when I was transferred to the London, Yeovil and Exeter
Mail.&nbsp; <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>We had a very sad accident with that Mail once between
Whitchurch and Andover.&nbsp; The coach used to start from
Piccadilly, where all the passengers and baggage were taken
up.&nbsp; On this occasion the Mail was brought up to Piccadilly
by me in a cart as usual, and we were off in a few seconds.&nbsp;
My coachman had been having a drinking bout with a friend that
day, and when we had got a few miles on the road I discovered
that coachee was the worse for drink, and that it was not safe
for him to drive; so when we reached Hounslow I made him get off
the box seat.&nbsp; After securing the Mail bags, and putting the
coachman in my seat and strapping him in, I took the
ribbons.&nbsp; At Whitchurch the coachman unstrapped himself and
exchanged places with me, but we had not proceeded more than
three miles when, the coach giving a jolt over a heap of stones,
he fell between the horses, and the wheels of the coach ran over
him, killing him on the spot.&nbsp; The horses, having no driver,
broke into <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>full gallop, so, as there was no front passenger, I
climbed over the roof to gather up the reins, when I found that
they had fallen among the horses&rsquo; feet and were trodden to
bits.&nbsp; Returning over the roof I missed my hold and fell
into the road, but fortunately with no worse result than some
bruises and a sprained ankle.&nbsp; The horses kept on until they
reached Andover, where they pulled up at the usual spot.&nbsp;
Strange to say, no damage was done to the coach, though there was
a very steep hill to go down.&nbsp; The old Exeter Mail, running
from London to Exeter, which came behind our coach, found the
body of my coachman on the road, and, a mile further on, picked
me up.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the excitement I had undergone, and
the bruising I had sustained, I took my Mails on to Exeter and
returned the next day for the inquest.</p>
<p>Accidents of one kind and another were not uncommon on the
road, though some, of course, made more impression on me than <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>others.&nbsp;
I remember that when bowling along towards Andover one very dark
night I noticed something lying at the side of the road.&nbsp;
The coachman pulled up, and I found that it was a man with his
head smashed to pieces.&nbsp; I wrapped the poor fellow&rsquo;s
remains in my shawl, and took them on to Andover, returning from
Exeter on the following day to be on the inquest.&nbsp; It turned
out that the man had been riding on the shaft of a lime waggon,
and falling off&mdash;probably while asleep&mdash;the wheels had
gone over his head.&nbsp; On another occasion, in a different
part of the country, when my coach was nearing Cheltenham, our
leaders knocked down a man who was walking along the road from
Cheltenham Fair.&nbsp; The front part of his head was crushed by
the horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and the wheels of the coach went over
him.</p>
<p>In 1838 I was transferred to the Cheltenham and Aberystwith
Mail, leaving Cheltenham at 7.0 a.m. and arriving at Aberystwith
at 9.0 p.m.&nbsp; I worked this Mail for 16 years&mdash;from 1838
to 1854&mdash;and this <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>was the most eventful period of my
career.&nbsp; The road ran through a fearful country, and we had
to go over Plinlimmon Mountain, the top of which is about 2,000
feet above the sea level.&nbsp; We had many accidents and
adventures with this coach.&nbsp; For example, we left Hereford
one market day, the wind blowing a hurricane.&nbsp; When we
reached St. Owen&rsquo;s turnpike gate I saw that the gate was
closed, and blew the horn for the gatekeeper to open it.&nbsp; He
threw the gate wide open, when it rebounded and struck one of the
leaders, which so frightened the team that they got completely
out of hand, and galloped down the road as fast as they could lay
feet to the ground.&nbsp; The coachman was a very nervous man,
and, finding he could not control the horses or pull them up, he
threw himself off the box into the road, with the result that the
back part of his head was dashed in.&nbsp; The horses, now at
full gallop, ran into a donkey cart in which an old woman and her
daughter were going home from market, and doubled it up <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>completely.&nbsp; The daughter heard the noise of the
approaching coach and jumped out in time to save herself, but the
poor old woman was kicked to death before I could cut the harness
to release the leaders, which had fallen and got mixed up with
the remains of the cart.&nbsp; I had the bodies of the old woman
and the coachman placed on hurdles and carried to the
Infirmary.&nbsp; Meanwhile the leaders had broken loose from the
coach and galloped on for about two miles.&nbsp; They did further
mischief by running into another cart, but without doing any
serious damage.&nbsp; There is little use reproaching the dead,
but it would have been a good thing for this poor coachman and
others if he had been as good a whip and possessed of as steady
nerves as the late Mr. Selby.&nbsp; If he had only stuck to his
post&mdash;as every coachman should in such
circumstances&mdash;this sad accident might have been
averted.</p>
<p>While I was on this Mail there was a dreadful flood all over
the country.&nbsp; I <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>think it was in the year 1852.&nbsp;
The rivers were so swollen, particularly the Severn and the Wye,
that it was difficult to get along the roads.&nbsp; Leaving
Gloucester at midnight on one occasion, all went on pretty well
until the coach reached Lugg Bridge, four miles from Hereford, or
rather the place where the bridge had been, for it had been
washed away in the night, and the coach, going along quickly,
fell into the rushing stream.&nbsp; Horses, coach, and coachman,
the guard (whose name was Couldry) and one passenger were carried
down the river about a mile and a half.&nbsp; The coachman caught
hold of one of the leaders which had broken loose, and he and the
horse were carried some distance and washed into a field, where
the animal was able to regain its footing.&nbsp; The other three
horses were drowned.&nbsp; The guard and the passenger managed to
catch hold of a tree as they floated down stream, and were
rescued after being some hours in the water, but unfortunately
the passenger died <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>some days after from the effects of his immersion.&nbsp;
On the following night I had a very unpleasant experience of the
flood.&nbsp; Coming within a mile and a half of Gloucester, we
found the water had risen considerably since the morning; so much
so that the coachman would not venture to proceed unless someone
went first to see what was the depth.&nbsp; I got down and walked
for about a hundred yards, with the water up to my armpits, and
called to them to come on, which they did; but unfortunately for
me they did not stop to pick me up, and there I was left for full
three hours on a dark night, in the water, surrounded by it on
all sides, and afraid to move one way or another for fear of
getting out of my depth.&nbsp; At last, almost in despair, I did
make an effort, and with great difficulty managed to get to
Gloucester, where I was put to bed and between warm blankets.</p>
<p>On another occasion on the same Mail we escaped with our lives
in an almost miraculous manner.&nbsp; This happened in <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>passing over
Plinlimmon.&nbsp; It was a fearful night.&nbsp; The snow had been
falling for hours before we got to the top of the mountain at
Stedfa-gerrig, and after going for about a mile downhill we found
ourselves enveloped in a dense fog and snow-storm.&nbsp; We
completely lost our way, although we had a postboy in front as
guide, but unfortunately he missed the road and took us over a
precipice about 60 feet deep.&nbsp; The coachman and I, without
any effort on our part, performed the acrobatic feat of turning
two complete somersaults before we reached the bottom.&nbsp; I
remember distinctly that my one thought was how I could avoid
being crushed under the falling coach.&nbsp; We both escaped
this, however, and, owing to the depth of the snow, were quite
unhurt by the fall, though much shaken of course.&nbsp; The two
inside passengers were cut about a good deal by the glass of the
windows, and two of the horses were killed.&nbsp; The next thing
was to right the coach and get the living horses loose, which was
an extremely difficult thing <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>to do, as the snow was very deep at
the bottom.&nbsp; It took us two hours to get things together
again, and fortunately we discovered that there was an old Roman
road near where we were, so at last we got started, and made up a
good deal of time before we got to Cheltenham, arriving there
just in time to catch the up London Mail.&nbsp; An account of
this accident was given in the <i>Hereford Times</i>
newspaper.</p>
<p>And yet another winter adventure on this Mail.&nbsp; We had
left Gloucester, and all went on pretty well until we came to
Radnor Forest, where we got caught in such a snow-storm that it
was impossible to take the coach any further, so we left
it.&nbsp; I took the Mail bags, and, with the assistance of two
shepherds, made my way over the mountains.&nbsp; It took us five
hours to get over to the other side to an inn at Llandewy.&nbsp;
There we met the up Mail Guard Couldry, who took my guides back
again.&nbsp; It was not many hours before the abandoned coach was
completely covered with <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>snow, and there it remained buried
for a week.&nbsp; Well, the up guard Couldry fell down in the
snow from exhaustion, and had to be carried by the two shepherds
to the Forest Inn on the other side of the mountain.&nbsp; There
he remained some days to recover himself.&nbsp; I had to proceed
with my bags, so I got a chaise and pair from Penybont and
another at Rhayader, but was unable to take that very far owing
to the snow.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to press on again
on foot, which I did for many miles until I came to
Llangerrig.&nbsp; There I found it was hopeless to think of going
over Plinlimmon, and was informed that nothing had crossed all
day, so I made up my mind to go round by way of Llanidloes, and a
night I had of it!&nbsp; I was almost tired out, and benumbed
with cold, which brought on a drowsiness I found it very hard to
resist.&nbsp; If I had yielded to the feeling for an instant I
should not have been telling these tales now.&nbsp; When I got
about eight miles from Aberystwith I found <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>myself
becoming thoroughly exhausted, so I hired a car for the remainder
of the journey, and fell fast asleep as soon as I got into
it.&nbsp; On arriving at Aberystwith I was still sound asleep,
and had to be carried to bed and a doctor sent for, who rubbed me
for hours before he could get my blood into circulation
again.&nbsp; I had then been exposed to that terrible weather for
fifty hours.&nbsp; Next day I felt a good deal better and started
back for Gloucester, but had great difficulty in getting over the
mountain.&nbsp; Again I had the honour of receiving a letter from
the Postmaster-General, complimenting me on my zeal and energy in
getting the Mail over the mountain.&nbsp; Even when there was no
snow, the wind on the top of Plinlimmon was often almost more
than we could contend with.&nbsp; Once, indeed, it was so strong
that it blew the coach completely over against a rock, but we
soon got that right again, and always afterwards took the
precaution of opening both the doors and tying them back, so that
the wind might pass <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>through the coach.&nbsp; Altogether I had good reason to
remember Plinlimmon, and, after all I have undergone in that
country in the way of floods and snow-storms, it is little wonder
if I am troubled with rheumatism now.</p>
<p>In 1854 the Mail Coach from Gloucester to Aberystwith ceased
running, and I was transferred to the London and Exeter
Railway.&nbsp; I travelled upon that line, working the Mail Bag
Apparatus and sorting and delivering the Mail bags, until the
year 1861, when I was placed at Paddington Station.&nbsp; There I
have been ever since, despatching and receiving Mail bags and
superintending the Parcel Post work at the station since its
commencement.&nbsp; It will be seen, therefore, that I have
worked for eighteen years on Mail Coaches, seven years on the
railway, and thirty years at Paddington Station.</p>
<p>I have often been asked if I had any encounters with
highwaymen in my coaching days.&nbsp; Many people seem to have an
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>idea that
the stoppage of Mail Coaches by Dick Turpin and his followers was
an event of frequent occurrence.&nbsp; All I can say is that in
my experience of the road nothing of the kind ever happened to my
coach except once, and then I was like to have done myself more
injury than the highwaymen did.&nbsp; It was in the year 1836,
when I was travelling on the Bristol and Portsmouth Mail.&nbsp;
One night, between Bath and Warminster, two men jumped out of the
hedge; one caught hold of the leaders, and the other the
wheelers, and tried to stop the coach.&nbsp; My coachman
immediately whipped up the horses and called out to me, saying
&ldquo;Look out! we are going to be robbed!&rdquo;&nbsp; I took
the blunderbuss out of the sword case (which was a box just in
front of the guard&rsquo;s seat); but, just as I did so, I saw
the fellows making towards the hedge, and then lost sight of them
altogether.&nbsp; To let them know that I was prepared I fired
off into the hedge.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I hit
anything; I heard no <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>cries or groans; but I do know that
the recoil of the blunderbuss nearly knocked me off my
seat.&nbsp; I have had many hard knocks in my time, but that
blunderbuss kicked like a mule.&nbsp; No doubt it was loaded to
the muzzle, as was usual with those weapons.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Occasionally of late years I have been reminded of my old
coaching days.&nbsp; A few years ago the Marquess of Worcester
kindly invited me to go down with him to Brighton by coach.&nbsp;
On the journey I was able to tell the Marquess that I knew the
late Duke of Beaufort, who used very often to take the reins
between Gloucester and Hereford when going down to one of his
country seats in Monmouthshire.&nbsp; A splendid whip he was
too.&nbsp; It was quite a treat to ride behind him, and every
coachman and guard was pleased to see him, he was so affable and
pleasant to all.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One of the Wards&mdash;I think it was Harry&mdash;used to
drive me on the &ldquo;Quicksilver&rdquo; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Exeter Mail,
on which I acted as guard for a short period.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I notice very much change in the
manners and habits of people from what they were in my younger
days.&nbsp; As regards my Post Office work, however, the change
has been most wonderful, and at Christmas time the Mails
despatched by me from Paddington to places on the Great Western
Line have grown to be a hundredfold of the quantity we used to
carry by coach.</p>

<h2><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>OTHER
COACHING INCIDENTS.</h2>
<h3>COACHES IN SNOW-STORMS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great snow-storm of Christmas,
1836, was long remembered as one of the most severe on record,
and Mr. Nobbs&rsquo; coach was only one of many that had to be
abandoned owing to the depth of the snow-drifts.&nbsp; All over
England, and in Scotland as well, most of the roads were rendered
impassable.&nbsp; Some coaches, after proceeding for miles on
their journey, were forced to return; thus the Brighton Mail from
London had to put back after getting as far as Crawley, and the
Dover Mail got no further than Gravesend.&nbsp; Other coaches
were upset, and some were completely lost, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>having been
abandoned, and afterwards buried in the snow-wreaths.&nbsp; Near
Chatham the snow lay to a depth of 30 or 40 feet, and on some of
the roads in the Midlands, after cuttings had been made, the snow
was banked to the height of 50 feet.&nbsp; A full account of this
and other memorable snowstorms will be found in Mr. Wilson
Hyde&rsquo;s most interesting book, &ldquo;The Royal
Mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>History repeats itself, and more than fifty years after that
1836 storm we again find Mail Coaches blocked by the snow on the
Brighton road.&nbsp; The severe snow-storm of the 9th and 10th of
March last taxed the resources of the Post Office in the South
and West of England to the utmost.&nbsp; For several days
Plymouth was virtually without any service of Mails, and one
after another came an apparently endless series of telegrams to
headquarters in London, bearing dismal tidings of trains buried
in mammoth drifts, cuttings blocked with snow, and portentous
&ldquo;accumulations&rdquo; of parcel receptacles at places quite
unprepared <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>to bear so large a share of the Post Office
burden.&nbsp; The trials and triumphs of that stirring time have,
however, already found a capable chronicler&mdash;as readers of
the <i>St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand</i> Magazine will shortly
discover.&nbsp; All we would refer to here is the fact that the
up and down Brighton Parcel Coaches were both blocked by snow at
Handcross Hill, about four miles from Crawley&mdash;one at the
top of the hill and the other at the bottom.&nbsp; The resources
of civilisation in 1891, however, afforded a means of overcoming
the difficulty which was not open to our fathers and
grand-fathers in 1836.&nbsp; An experienced officer (Mr. W.
Roberts) went down from London by train and superintended the
digging out of the coaches.&nbsp; This done, he had both vehicles
taken to Crawley, where the parcel baskets were transferred to
the railway.&nbsp; In 1836 those parcels would probably not have
reached their destination under a week or ten days.</p>
<h3><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>BRIDGE
DISASTER TO COACH.</h3>
<p>Mr. Nobbs&rsquo; graphic account of the Lugg Bridge accident
recalls the more calamitous one which befell the Glasgow and
Carlisle coach on the 25th October, 1801.&nbsp; The circumstances
were alike in both cases, but the results of the earlier disaster
were much more grave.&nbsp; The bridge was one spanning the river
Evan, between Elvanfoot and Beattock; it had collapsed under
stress of a flood following a sudden thaw, and at about ten
o&rsquo;clock at night the coach plunged into the rocky bed of
the stream.&nbsp; Two outside passengers were killed on the spot,
and the coachman sustained such injuries that he died some days
afterwards.&nbsp; The inside passengers, a lady and three
gentlemen, and the guard, escaped with injuries more or less
severe.&nbsp; Three of the horses were killed, and the coach was
smashed to pieces.</p>
<h3><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>ROBBERY OF MAILS.</h3>
<p>If Mr. Nobbs had been on the road some twenty or thirty years
earlier he might have acquired a larger experience of the manners
and customs of highwaymen&mdash;or perhaps we should say mail
robbers,&mdash;for the picturesque highwayman of romance is
conspicuously absent from Post Office annals.&nbsp; In this
connexion it may be interesting to give the text of two or three
Post Office Notices issued early in the century.&nbsp; This one
is typical of many others circulated about the same
time:&mdash;</p>

recorded in which, the robbery, capture, examination by
magistrate, trial, sentence, and execution were all comprised in
the space of one week.&nbsp; There was nothing
&ldquo;leaden-footed&rdquo; about that justice.</p>
<h3>MAIL COACHMEN AND MAIL GUARDS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Nobbs&rsquo; reference to the skill of the present Duke of
Beaufort&rsquo;s father as a &ldquo;whip,&rdquo; a skill which
seems to be hereditary in that family, reminds us of the fact
that the same nobleman, while Marquess of Worcester, habitually
drove the &ldquo;Beaufort&rdquo; coach on the Brighton
Road.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Age&rdquo; coach, on the same road, was
driven by Sir Vincent Cotton, and the Hon. Fred. Jerningham <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>acted as
coachman to the Brighton day mail.&nbsp; It would appear,
therefore, that in the days when stage coaching was a serious
business, aristocratic amateurs of four-in-hand driving were as
much in evidence as they are now.&nbsp; Many of them were, of
course, unknown to their passengers, and the historians of the
old coaching days allege that they were in the habit of pocketing
their tips in a matter-of-course manner which would have done
credit to the oldest regular coachman on the road.</p>
<p>But it was the guard who was the person of greatest importance
on a Mail Coach, and he was generally fully conscious of his own
dignity, and inclined to &ldquo;stand upon&rdquo; it on the
slightest provocation.&nbsp; It was necessary, however, that the
guards should be men of strict probity, as they were often
entrusted with commissions of great consequence, such as the
conveyance of large sums of money for bankers, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Moreover, they <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>were principally dependent for their income upon fees
received from the public, and in some cases, it is said, those
fees amounted to as much as 300<i>l.</i> a year.&nbsp; It is
obvious that this system was one that opened a door to corruption
and abuse had the guards been unscrupulous men.&nbsp; The payment
made to them by the Post Office was but half a guinea, a
week&mdash;a sort of retaining fee&mdash;or just sufficient, with
the uniform, to mark them as servants of the Department.&nbsp;
Thus, when the Post Office guards began to be employed on the
railways, the Postmaster-General had to apply to the Treasury for
authority to pay them in salaries, &ldquo;inasmuch as it was
clear that they would have no chance of obtaining
fees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some time afterwards the Postmaster-General
made a second application to the Treasury, stating &ldquo;that on
certain lines of road, owing to the competition of the railways
(with the coaches), the number of passengers by coaches was
greatly reduced, and that, consequently, the guards had lost many
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of their
fees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Treasury granted permission to
pay the guards employed on coaches, in certain cases, at the same
rate as the Post Office guards on the railways.</p>
<p>The Stage Coach system was already in its decline when Mr.
Nobbs took up duty in 1836.&nbsp; In 1837&mdash;the year of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Accession&mdash;52 Mail Guards were appointed; in
1840, 19; in 1843, only 1.&nbsp; The total number of Mail Guards
in the United Kingdom in 1841 was 365; in 1843 it had fallen to
327.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out by a recent writer that the Mail Bag
Apparatus now in use on the railways had its prototype in the
days of the stage coaches, when the Mail bags were held out on
the end of a stick to be clutched by the guard as the coach
hurried past.&nbsp; Many of these exchanges were, of course, made
in the night, and a former officer of the Surveying Staff in the
North of Scotland vouches for the <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>truth of the following
anecdote.&nbsp; At one of the offices in
Caithness&mdash;Dunbeath, he believes&mdash;the coach used to
pass very early in the morning, and the Sub-Postmaster was in the
habit of keeping the bags ready for despatch in his
bedroom.&nbsp; The blowing of the horn warned him of the approach
of the coach, and the guard used to come and receive the bags out
of the bedroom window.&nbsp; Once, on a dark rainy night, the
guard was handed what he supposed to be the Mail bags, and the
coach proceeded some little distance on its way, when, to his
disgust, the guard discovered that instead of Mail bags he was
carrying off a portion of the Sub-Postmaster&rsquo;s
apparel.&nbsp; The coach was turned back, and once more, to his
astonishment, the sleepy Sub-Postmaster heard the tootle of the
horn and hastened to the window to inquire what might be the
matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, mon!&rdquo; shouted the guard,
&ldquo;gie&rsquo;s the bags an&rsquo; tak&rsquo; in yer
breeks!&rdquo;&nbsp; Needless to say the incident afforded the
passengers much amusement.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>In
taking leave of the last of the old Mail Coach Guards we may
quote from a recent issue of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> the
following paragraph relative to one who was perhaps the oldest
surviving stage coachman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of the olden time has passed away in
William Clements of Canterbury, who, before the present century
had reached its twenties, drove the famous &lsquo;Tally-ho&rsquo;
Coach which plied between the Cathedral City and Gracechurch
Street.&nbsp; More than once he had to run the gauntlet of
robbers and highwaymen, of whom, however, he had a decidedly low
opinion.&nbsp; Railways killed his Coach.&nbsp; Clements
reluctantly admitted the superiority of the iron horse to his own
teams, although he never relinquished the idea that
England&rsquo;s degeneracy commenced when the
&lsquo;Tally-ho&rsquo; and other coaches were vanquished by
&lsquo;Puffing Billy.&rsquo;&nbsp; He died in his ninety-first
year, <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and
perhaps is entitled to be called the &lsquo;Last of the
Whips.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Clements was not, however, the &ldquo;Last of the
Whips.&rdquo;&nbsp; While these sheets were passing through the
press we had the pleasure of an interview with another veteran,
Mr. Harry Ward, of whom mention is made on page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page35">35</a></span>.&nbsp; Mr.
Ward states that he is 78 years of age, though, judging by his
hale and active appearance, one would pronounce him to be ten
years younger.&nbsp; He drove the London and Glasgow Mail so far
back as the year 1833, at which time he was the youngest coachman
on the road.&nbsp; Mr. Ward assures us that in all his fifty
years&rsquo; experience he never had an accident to his
coach.&nbsp; To the remark that this must surely be a unique
record, he replied, with pardonable pride, that he was reckoned
&ldquo;the champion coachman&rdquo; of his time.&nbsp; Such was
his fame, indeed, that after the London and Exeter Coach had
twice met with serious mishaps, some of the leading inhabitants
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of Devon
and Cornwall sent a strongly worded memorial to the authorities,
asking that Harry Ward might be placed on the box; and he was
transferred accordingly.&nbsp; Mr. Ward, whose memory is
wonderfully clear, has a distinct recollection of the great
snow-storm of 1836, when his coach was one of several that were
snowed up on Salisbury Plain.&nbsp; He, too, knew the members of
the Beaufort family well; indeed it was he who taught the present
scions of that house the &ldquo;art and mystery&rdquo; of
four-in-hand driving.&nbsp; We are glad to be able to add that
Mr. Ward is in good health, and still quite capable of managing a
team.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
